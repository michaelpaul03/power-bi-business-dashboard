🧩 Data Modeling Approach

Imported dataset into Power BI

Established relationships between tables

Designed a structured data model

Created reusable DAX measures for KPIs

Ensured efficient performance and filtering

📊 Key KPIs Developed (Using DAX)
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])

Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])

Profit % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)

Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Order ID])

Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Customer ID])

These measures dynamically update based on slicers and filters applied in the report.
